Install materal-ui by npm install @material-ui/core
Install react-grid-layout by npm install react-grid-layout
Start the json server by json server --watch api.json --port 3004
Start the application with npm start, the default port is locahost:3000


How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
1 Used material-ui since it is one of most popular react UI component design
2 Used React-grid-layout to build a simple layout structure

Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
1 All css style info should stored in CSS file
2 Instead of single file application, I should break it into several different react components
3 Add Jest (unit test) on all components
4 Videos from different candidates can have difference sizes which is not handle properly right now
5 Save all dependencies into package.json, all setup should be done from single command

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
1 Make several components instead of single file
2 Use redux to handle global variable
3 Build the middleware instread of calling api in the components
